# Introduction

**zxcvbn** is a password strength estimator inspired by password crackers.
It recognizes and analyzes over 40 thousand common passwords using pattern matching and conservative estimation and
filters out common first names, last names, popular words from Wikipedia and common words in many cultures,
and recognizes common patterns like dates, repetitions (e.g. 'aaa'), sequences (e.g. 'abcd'), keyboard smashes (e.g. 'qwertyuiop'), and l33t speak.

Consider using **zxcvbn** as an algorithmic alternative to password composition policy â€” it is more secure,
flexible, and convenient in websites that require a minimal complexity score.

- More secure: policies often fail, allowing weak passwords (P@ssword1) and blocking strong passwords.
- More flexible: **zxcvbn** allows many password styles to flourish as long as sufficient complexity is provided, i.e.
  passphrases are rated highly given enough uncommon words, keyboard patterns are ranked based on length and number of repetitions,
  and capitalization adds more complexity when it's _unpredictaBle_.
- More convenient: **zxcvbn** is designed to power simple, rule-free interfaces that give instant feedback.
  Additionally, **zxcvbn** includes minimal, targeted, verbose feedback that can help guide users towards more complex passwords.

## Performance

**zxcvbn** operates below human perception of delay for most input: ~5-20ms for ~25 character passwords on modern browsers/CPUs, ~100ms for passwords around 100 characters.
To curb runtime latency for really long passwords, consider sending `zxcvbn.check()` only the first 100 characters or so of user input. 
For security reasons a limit was implemented for 256 characters by default but can be customized it with `maxLength`.


## Change prior to original library

- I18n support for feedback, dictionaries and keyboard patterns. By default, the feedback are keys now
- All dictionaries are optional, but the `en` dictionary is highly recommend (wished feature in some issues)
- Dictionaries are separate from the core library. This means zxcvbn-ts is relatively small without its dictionaries
- compress dictionaries for smaller bundle size => up to 33% smaller dictionaries while having more entries
- The project is a monorepo with a core library `@zxcvbn-ts/core` and language packages `@txcvbn-ts/language-en`.
- Keyboard layouts can be customised. This means you can overwrite the default set of layouts with your own or extend it.
  E.g., if you are developing a Russian website, you need to include a Cyrillic keyboard set. Create a PR so that others can benefit from it.
- You can use multiple keyboard layouts, which means that the library will check against them by default.
- the tests are Jest based, so we get a coverage score
- eslint/prettier for consistent code style
- Added static page docs https://zxcvbn-ts.github.io/zxcvbn/
- esm, commonJS
- Custom matcher can be added which means you can create your own matcher
- Async matcher can be added which means you can create a matcher that makes an API call
- [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) matcher
- included debounce helper
- levenshtein check for the dictionaries
- diceware dictionary
- extended l33t matcher for substitutions like `|_| => u`
